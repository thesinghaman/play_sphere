## üåü About The Project

**PlaySphere** is a robust, scalable, and secure backend system designed to power a full-featured video-sharing platform analogous to YouTube. It handles everything from user authentication and channel management to complex social interactions like subscriptions, likes, and comments.

The core of PlaySphere is a set of well-defined RESTful APIs that provide a complete foundation for any front-end application to build a rich user experience upon.
